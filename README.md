## Introduction
Hi, I'm Tanner, an Associate Software Developer with InsightsNow, Inc. in Corvallis, OR. I've been programming as a hobby for nearly a decade, educationally for 3 years, and professionally now for over a year.

Web development is where I got my start, with JavaScript being my first language, but I've expanded from there over the years. Coding remains one of my hobbies, with new technologies offering interesting challenges and solutions for personal projects. Some of my recent projects are available in this repo, once a part of a different account that is no longer in use. Also included is the repo used for my Senior Project at Western Oregon University, my alma mater.

## Education
I graduated from Western Oregon University summa cum laude in the Summer of 2020 with a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and a minor in Art and Design. Coursework initially used C++ as a basis for teaching the fundamental concepts of programming, including object-oriented methodologies. From there we were encouraged to use different languages to demonstrate knowledge of data structures, language architecture, and algorithms, including instruction in different language paradigms.

Our Senior Project was a year-long sequence in which groups of four students were tasked with following a Scrum/Agile SDLC to build a functional Web Application in the .NET Framework. My roles in the development process were varied, but I helped to implement a lot of the dynamic functionality through JavaScript, specifically using React in tandem with the traditional MVC design pattern to make the website faster and more responsive. I also took the initiative to write a companion application for Android in Kotlin, which utilized a REST api made available by the main website.

A demonstration of the website and application can be seen [here](https://digitalcommons.wou.edu/aes/229/).

## Relevant Work Experience
I was hired as an intern at InsightsNow, Inc. in March of 2020, before I graduated. Working between part and full time as I finished my degree, I learned about the existing codebase, legacy systems, and the roadmap for future development. In addition to maintaining existing software, I was quickly tasked with contributing to the production environment creating both internal and client-facing tools, mainly in a full-stack context. Not long after I graduated, I was offered a full-time position and am currently still employed there. Some noteable acheivements in my time there include:
- implementing server-side Blazor in order to produce responsive client-facing applications
- using drop-in React components compatible with the existing codebase
- re-writing stylesheets to create a uniform experience for clients and internal users
- using Azure to implement serverless automations among several systems, including HubSpot
- working with production databases including applying automatic and manual migrations of data via ORM and hand-written scripts
- helping to implement a new authentication provider
- containerizing legacy applications for migration to cloud servers
- assisting with the transition to an iterative SDLC from a more linear model
